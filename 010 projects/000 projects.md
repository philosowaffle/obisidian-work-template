> The Project Notes are for tracking projects with a start and end date. These projects may be short or long lived. They generally create other artifacts as a result. See [010 Projects](../002%20meta/vault%20specification/Folder%20Organization.md#010%20Projects).

> This note is a placeholder for the template vault to ensure the empty folder gets committed. You may delete this note once cloned.
