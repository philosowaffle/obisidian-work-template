### Finding Information

If all you want to do is query this vault for information then I recommend reading through [[Note Discoverability]] and [[Folder Organization]] to get an understanding of how to find information in the vault.

Additionally, you may want to consider using this vault with your favorite AI tool to streamline finding information.
