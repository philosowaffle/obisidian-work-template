# Work Knowledge Base

This repository serves as a knowledge base for work-related information, such as meeting notes, project documentation, and a general wiki.

## Getting Started

This Vault is primarily maintained using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) markdown editor. While you may open these folders in any editor of your choice, you will get the most complete experience by using Obsidian.

### Finding Information

If all you want to do is query this vault for information then I recommend reading through [[Note Discoverability]] and [[Folder Organization]] to get an understanding of how to find information in the vault.

Additionally, you may want to consider using this vault with your favorite AI tool to streamline finding information.

### Using the Vault

If you plan to use this vault or adopt portions of this workflow then here is where you can start for a crash course.
