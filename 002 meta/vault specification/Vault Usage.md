# Vault Usage

This note attempts to help establish a mental model for thinking about how to use this vault.

The vault primarily revolves around [[Project Notes]], [[Resource Notes]], and [[Periodic Notes]].

Each day it is recommended to start by creating that days [[Periodic Notes|Daily Note]] (`ctrl+h`). This note becomes your home page for the day. Anytime you need to jot something down use this note to do that. You can always re-organize the information later.

The [[Periodic Notes|Daily Note]] provides a handful of dynamic views to help surface **Active Projects**, **Outstanding Todos**, and the current days **Meetings**. These views are generated by querying properties on note files across the vault. For this reason, its best to use the provided templates for most [[Note Types|Note Type]] creation to ensure the correct properties are applied.

During a day you will likely work on [[Project Notes|Projects]] and have [[Meeting Notes|Meetings]].  

Active projects are saved in the `010 projects` folder for streamlined access. To create a new Project simply using the [[Project Notes#✨ Creating a New Project Note|quick add template]]. To quickly jump to an existing [[Project Notes|Project Note]] you can use the `Go To` command `ctrl+t` and type the name of the Project.

Like the [[Periodic Notes|Daily Note]], [[Project Notes]] provide a few dynamic views to help you keep track of **Outstanding Todos** and **Related Meetings.** They also have a [[Log Sections|Log Section]] which lets you easily keep track of updates to that Project. Throughout the vault, the [[Log Sections|Log Section]] can be used to keep track of important updates and associate those back to the dated [[Periodic Notes|Daily Note]].

Each day, its helpful to create placeholder [[Meeting Notes]] up front for that day's meetings. Use the [[Meeting Notes#✨Creating A New Generic Meeting|quick add template]] to create these. If a meeting is associated with a Project, then you can add links to the relevant [[Project Notes]] in the Meeting properties.
