# Vault Usage

This note attempts to help establish a mental model for thinking about how to use this vault.

The vault primarily revolves around [[Periodic Notes]], [[Project Notes]], and [[Resource Notes]].

Each day it is recommended to start by creating that days [[Periodic Notes|Daily Note]] (`ctrl+h`).[^4] This note becomes your home page for the day. Anytime you need to jot something down use this note to do that. You can always re-organize the information later. Another way to create Daily Notes is by using the [[Calendar Plugin|Calendar]][^1] or the Command Palette (`ctrl + p`).

The [[Periodic Notes|Daily Note]] provides a handful of dynamic views to help surface **Active Projects**, **Outstanding Todos**, and the current days **Meetings**. These views are generated by querying properties on note files across the vault. For this reason, its best to use the provided templates[^5] for most [[Note Types|Note Type]] creation to ensure the correct properties are applied.

During a day you will likely work on [[Project Notes|Projects]] and have [[Meeting Notes|Meetings]].  

Active projects are saved in the `010 projects` folder for streamlined access. To create a new Project simply using the [[Project Notes#âœ¨ Creating a New Project Note|quick add template]]. To quickly jump to an existing [[Project Notes|Project Note]] you can use the `Go To` command (`ctrl+t`) and type the name of the Project.

Like the [[Periodic Notes|Daily Note]], [[Project Notes]] provide a few dynamic views to help you keep track of **Outstanding Todos** and **Related Meetings.** They also have a [[Log Sections|Log Section]] which lets you easily keep track of updates to that Project. Throughout the vault, the [[Log Sections|Log Section]] can be used to keep track of important updates and associate those back to the dated [[Periodic Notes|Daily Note]].

Each day, its helpful to create placeholder [[Meeting Notes]] up front for that day's scheduled meetings. Use the [[Meeting Notes#âœ¨Creating A New Generic Meeting|quick add template]] to create these. If a meeting is associated with a Project, then you can add links to the relevant [[Project Notes]] in the Meeting properties.

As you work on Projects or other tasks you may discover new information that is worth documenting, this atomic information can be captured in [[Resource Notes]]. These notes all live in `030 resources` and are the backbone of building up your own personal wikipedia of knowledge.

## To Sum This All Up:

1. [[Periodic Notes]] (like the Daily Note) help anchor time
2. [[Project Notes]] help you track projects or tasks with a completion goal
3. [[Resource Notes]] help you document and build up long term knowledge

By linking information together across these core notes you will begin to build your own knowledge graph[^2] where each piece of information links in some way back to other relevant items, whether they be Projects or Meetings or just nuggets of information.
