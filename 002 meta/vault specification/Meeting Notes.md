# Meeting Notes

Individual note files are created for each Meeting. This is primarily to help keep Project notes shorter and notes in general more atomic.

There are currently three types of meeting notes:

| Meeting Type | Description                                                                                             | Read More               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Generic      | Default meeting note template suitable for all kinds of meetings unless a more specific template exists | [[meeting_template]]    |
| 1:1          | For capturing 1:1 meeting notes with another person                                                     | [[meeting_person_sync]] |
| Recurring    | For capturing recurring meetings that happen with a group of people, a team, or related to a project    | [[Recurring Meetings]]  |
