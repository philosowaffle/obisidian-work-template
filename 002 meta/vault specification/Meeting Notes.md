# Meeting Notes

Individual note files are created for each Meeting. This is primarily to help keep Project notes shorter and notes in general more atomic.

There are currently three types of meeting notes:

| Meeting Type | Description                                                                                             | Read More               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Generic      | Default meeting note template suitable for all kinds of meetings unless a more specific template exists | [[meeting_template]]    |
| 1:1          | For capturing 1:1 meeting notes with another person                                                     | [[meeting_person_sync]] |
| Recurring    | For capturing recurring meetings that happen with a group of people, a team, or related to a project    | [[Recurring Meetings]]  |

## ✨Creating A New Generic Meeting

1. If this meeting is related to an ongoing Project or other Note, then navigate to that Notes [[Log Sections|Log Section]] and place your cursor on a new log entry
2. Use `ctrl+shft+n` to launch the [[QuickAdd Plugin]] Wizard
3. Choose `Meeting > Generic`
4. Enter the name of the meeting, do not add `Meeting` to the end
5. The meeting will be created in `040 archives/Meetings` and a link to the note will be created at the current position of your cursor (see step 1)
