# Note Types

"Note Types" describe the different categories of notes that are created in the vault. These types can be used to help create filtered views, queries, and bases focusing on only certain categories.

The type of a note is defined using a `tag`. A given Note Type may have additional properties, these properties should follow the naming convention of `<Note Type Name <Property>`.
