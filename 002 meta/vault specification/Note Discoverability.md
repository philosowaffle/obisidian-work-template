# Note Discoverability

If you can't find what you need, when you need it, then what good are your notes?

**Pillars of discoverability in my notes:**

1. Search function across all notes
2. Links between related notes
3. Naming and organizational conventions
4. Time stamping most notes

The above don't quite cover all ofÂ [LATCH](https://www.davisandco.com/blog/need-organize-content-latch-it#:~:text=The%20premise%20of%20LATCH%20is,%2C%20Time%2C%20Category%20and%20Hierarchy.), but they cover enough for me:Â _Alphabet, Time, Category, Hierarchy_

**When I need to find information or compile new information, the process goes like this:**

1. Notes app
    1. Do I think I know the name of an existing relevant note?
        1. Yes â†’ Go to that note â†’ done
        2. ðŸ”¥Use `ctrl+t` ([shortcuts](Shortcuts.md)) to launch `Go To`
    2. Do a global search for relevant keywords and phrases?
        1. Found Results â†’ done
        2. ðŸ”¥Use `ctrl + shft + f`
    3. Do I remember about when I would have written it down?
        1. Yes â†’ Look at notes created or edited around that time frame (log section on Projects is also really helpful for this)
        2. ðŸ”¥Either trying searching for a specific date, or use the Calendar plugin to view all notes connected to a particular daily note
    4. Do I remember what type of note I may have written?
        1. Yes â†’ Look through tags for that category of note
    5. If all of this fails, and I think this information is worth knowing for next time, then create a new note
2. Jira
    1. Use Jira search to find tickets and AC, this is helpful to understand past Product thinking and past Design decisions
        1. Add links to useful tickets back to personal notes on that topic
3. Confluence
    1. Use Confluence to see if anyone as created a wiki on the topic
        1. Add links of useful wikis back to personal notes on that topic
4. Slack
    1. Only if I'm really desperate, or I specifically remember a useful conversation happened somewhere
        1. Add links of useful threads back to personal notes on that topic

## Using AI Tools

Since this vault is composed of primarily plain markdown files with yaml frontmatter, it can easily be adapted as context for an AI tool.

This can be a powerful way to not only query the vault but also update and maintain information.
