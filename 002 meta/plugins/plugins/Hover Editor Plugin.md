# 🔌 Hover Editor Plugin

> [!danger] Uninstalled
> I liked it at first, but over time I got more frustrated that I had to manually close the windows and when needed I could never remember how to open the note in the main window.

Use `Cmd + E` shortcut to toggle between Reading and Editing. Opens with Reading view my default. Handy for quickly referencing notes and even pinning them in floating panes.
