# 🔌 Periodic Notes Plugin

Using for Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly reviews. Extends the core Daily Note feature and the [[Calendar Plugin]]

## 📝 Notes

Daily Notes are still managed by the Obsidian core Daily Note plugin, this is to also take advantage of having Obsidian open the daily note by default on launch.

All other Periodic Notes are configured and handled by this plugin.
