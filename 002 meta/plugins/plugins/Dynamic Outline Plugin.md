# 🔌 Dynamic Outline Plugin

> [!danger] Uninstalled
> Kinda slow and I didn't really seem to use it all that much more than the built in outline.

Shows outline automatically as a type of floating menu. Not sure if I will like this, but want to see anyway. This would ideally replace the default outline plugin that I often forget to look at.
