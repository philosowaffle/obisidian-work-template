# 🔌 Pixel Banner Plugin

Provides nice banner images added to the top of notes.

## 📝 Notes

Use command palette to open the Pixel Banner Settings for any given note.

Images are all saved to `001 attachments`. Currently in use by [[daily_note_template]].

Best to use this on notes with Properties hidden since this plugin adds a lot of properties which are ugly to look at and make it hard to find the properties I need.

💡I may look into doing something like [this custom css](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/hide-certain-properties/74777) to hide the Banner properties if I end up using this plugin a lot.
